### Welcome

# A Work In Progress

This online course was made for complete beginners that are not sure where to start and I assume students to be in middle/high school or older and want to be self taught. I want to show that it is not that hard to learn and I am making this course to be something that I wished existed when I was in high school.

The course is also based on 6 years of teaching and self teaching myself programming to teach it. With plenty of written resources and videos of concepts scattered around, I want to bring together every thing with practice to understand concepts.
